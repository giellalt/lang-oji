!Rules
!###############

!this rule bled itself historically
!never applied in sub-minimal words
!minimality was tricky.
!   SS sequences permitted no deletion (glides or vowels)
!       SSG could have been optimal iambic foot if codas contributed morae!
!       so there might have been a nuanced notion of minimality
!   SL sequences permitted glide deletion
!   L sequences permitted glide deletion

define ApocopeHist NonConsShort -> 0 || _ .#. ;

!There is an alternative analysis of apocope, but it is hairy
!need to specify inflected verb
!is bled by [n] deletion in Odawa (Piggott 1974)

define ApocopeMod VShort -> 0 || _ .#. ;

!Part of a conspiracy against vowel hiatus
!Also possible for V1 in V1V2 to delete
!Not totally confident that environment covers all cases (necessary, not sufficient)

define HiatusDel VShort -> 0 || VLong _ ;

define HiatusPre 0 -> d || %^ _ Vowel ;

!as Vowel is currently defined /aansaa/ will trigger epenthesis
!Miikka!

define HiatusEpen 0 -> ' || Vowel _ Vowel ;

!The weirdo rule
!traceable to VwV becoming oo in Proto-Alg (Goddard 1972?)
!   o<*w@ 
!but there must have been some sort of reanalysis
!otherwise why coalesce when there is now an epenthetic d?
!This is the other rule that refers to the prefix-stem boundary

define OLengthen o -> o o || %^ _ ; 

!Kaye 1973 (71?) As I recall there was a morpheme boundary in at least one rule

define Coalescence1 a w i -> o o || _ ;

define Coalsecence2 a w i -> a a || _ k ;

!-----
!controversial abstract phonology
!some of these rules use, or should use, segments that are not yet in Sigma
!-----

!yarg! how to just specify a feature that changes and keep the rest
!want t->ch, d->j, s->sh
!s->sh is pretty rare, counter-fed by i<*e. Valentine transcribes with S
!does non-alternating /s/ come from a different historical source?
!or were they all before *e?

!S not in Sigma
define Palatalization1 TDS -> [ ch | j | sh ] || _ i ;

!now we get to some fun stuff.
!n<*l alternates with zh, but n<*n does not
!i<*i triggers the alternation, but i<*e does not
!Bloomfield transcribed the palatalizing ns as "N". Valentine too.
!no special transcription for i<*e since it didn't alternate in the daughter langs
!we can recapitulate history here, or have a lot of lex exceptions
!Valentine states that only n<*l<*T alternates
!Kiparsky-Piggott in 70's stated that n<*l<*T and n<*l<*l alternate

!l not in Sigma
define Palatalization2Hist l -> zh || _ i ;

define Palatalization2Mod n -> zh || _ i ;

!i%<e not in Sigma
!is this how to define in all environments?

define LowShortRaising i%<e -> i || _ ;

!What happened to *sy?
define Palatalization3 [d | t | l ] y -> [ j | ch | zh ] || _ ; 

!-----
!end controversial abstract phonology
!-----

!Valentine 2001 'linking vowel'. There are others.
!The discussion on 339 almost makes it sound like [i] epenthesis follows syncope
!But I don't think that is right (and it can be read as it preceding too)
