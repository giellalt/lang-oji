!#Moving possessor features to end

!NB: extended prefix tags (+Px1Pl) are not in root.lexc, problem?

!intended: write +Px1Pl at end of string if string starts with 1+.*+1+Pl
define Px1Pl [ [..] -> %+Px1Pl || 1%+ ?* %+1 %+Pl ?* _ .#. ] ; !could specify leading .#. in envi, but this shouldn't be necessary (1+ is by definition string initial)
define Px1Sg [ [..] -> %+Px1Sg || 1%+ ?* _ .#. ] ; !this rule needs to be ordered after +1+Pl is cleaned out

define Px2Pl [ [..] -> %+Px2Pl || 2%+ ?* %+3 %+Pl ?* _ .#. ] ; 
define Px21Pl [ [..] -> %+Px21Pl || 2%+ ?* %+1 %+Pl ?* _ .#. ] ; 
define Px2Sg  [ [..] -> %+Px2Sg || 2%+ ?* _ .#. ] ;

!#Cleaning (deleting) possessor features
!###

!intended: delete the triggering information 
!it would be nice to have sub-rules like delete "1+", delete "+Pl"
!then they could be combined into bigger rules and deployed when envi is met
!otherwise the same changes get written out several times, varying only in envi

define Px1Plc1 [ 1%+ -> 0 || _ ?* %+1 %+Pl ] ; 
!intended: delete  +1+Pl seqs, but only if they are not preceded by 2+
!would be nice if we could have just one rule that zapped 1+ ... +1+Pl when they occurred together
define Px1Plc2 [ %+1 %+Pl -> 0 || ~[ 2%+ ] ?* _  ] ; 

define Px1Sgc [ 1%+ -> 0 ||  _ ] ; 

define Px2Plc1 [ 2%+ -> 0 || _ ?* %+3 %+Pl ] ; 
define Px2Plc2 [ %+3 %+Pl -> 0 || ~[ 3%+ ] ?* _  ] ; 

define Px21Plc1 [ 2%+ -> 0 || _ ?* %+1 %+Pl ] ; 
define Px21Plc2 [ %+1 %+Pl -> 0 || ~[ 1%+ ] ?* _  ] ;
