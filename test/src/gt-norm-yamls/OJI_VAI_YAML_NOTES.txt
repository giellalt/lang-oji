## independent

X person prefixes (slot 1) are incompatible with 3rd person number suffixes (5)

X person prefixes (slot 1) are incompatible with 3rd person suffixes in slot 3

X local number suffixes (slot 3) are incompatible with 3rd person number suffixes (5)

local person singulars in preterite or dubitative have "naa" before mode suffixes
    Px[1|2]+...^[+[1|2]Pl]+[Pret|Dub] -> naa[ban|dig]

local person plurals in preterite or dubitative have "aa" before mode suffixes
    Px[1|2]+...+[1|2]Pl+[Pret|Dub]    ->  aa[ban|dig]
    not whole story ...
    2pl suffix is -m, but 2pl pret/dub is not -maaban/-maadig
        it is -mwaaban/-mwaadig (232, 233)

word-final n's in following suffixes delete
    +1Pl -> min#
    +Pret -> ban# (conj, ind)
    +PretDub -> goban#
    +Prob2sg -> ken#
    +Iter -> in# 

Valentine's paradigms show some wiCV sequences that surface as C, postulated to handle some nasal-final verbs. need to look more closely

#n-deletion
#+Pret+3[Obv|Pl] -> banii[n|g]
#+Dub+3[Obv|Pl] -> digena[n|g]
#apocope
#   [w|a|i|o] -> 0#
#   preceding n-deletion
#nasal final stems (note also conjunct)
#coalescence
#   n-wa[g|n] -> oo[g|n] (nasal-final stems)
#epenthesis (dialect, indiv variation)
#   n-C -> n[a|i|o]C
#glide insertion does not apply (redundant, already noted)
#Lenition
#    n-si[i|w] -> nzi[i|w]

#Valentine pp 226 is coy on nasal-final stems: "some of the more important and systematic differences are outlined here", will want to exhaust list :)
#more coyness regarding independent preterite 3rd person plurals (p 227): Such forms may also be used by some speakers of Nishnaabemwin

#todo (conjunct)
#initial change (when does it apply?)
#+3sg -> g / n_
#+Neg+3sg -> sig
#+Neg+3pl -> sigwaa (hardcoded, may have been si-waa-g with movement of g (and s?))
#+Neg+3 -> si (w deleting before consonant)
#+[1|2] -> [y] after vowel-final stems ([y] epenthesis to break hiatus)
#+[3Obv|Indef] -> [a|i] after n-final stems (cluster repair, when a, when i?)
#d+ban (pret suff) -> p 
#+1sg+Pret aanh-ban -> aambaanh (when aambaan?)
#redundant discussion of (n)aa extensions in independent on p 228
#independent order pret dub is being replaced with conjunct order pret dub

# if we do syncope, infl w in coda deletes (p 229)
