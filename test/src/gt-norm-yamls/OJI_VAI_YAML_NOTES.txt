X person prefixes (slot 1) are incompatible with 3rd person number suffixes (5)

X person prefixes (slot 1) are incompatible with 3rd person suffixes in slot 3

X local number suffixes (slot 3) are incompatible with 3rd person number suffixes (5)

local person singulars in preterite or dubitative have "naa" before mode suffixes
    Px[1|2]+...^[+[1|2]Pl]+[Pret|Dub] -> naa[ban|dig]

local person plurals in preterite or dubitative have "aa" before mode suffixes
    Px[1|2]+...+[1|2]Pl+[Pret|Dub]    ->  aa[ban|dig]
    not whole story ...
    2pl suffix is -m, but 2pl pret/dub is not -maaban/-maadig
        it is -mwaaban/-mwaadig (232, 233)

word-final n's in following suffixes delete
    +1Pl -> min#
    +Pret -> ban# (conj, ind)
    +PretDub -> goban#
    +Prob2sg -> ken#
    +Iter -> in# 

Valentine's paradigms show some wiCV sequences that surface as C, postulated to handle some nasal-final verbs. need to look more closely

Valentine omits discussion of coalescence: awi -> aa / _ g, awi -> oo /  _ n
    very tempting to try to derive "naa", "aa" augmentations from a similar process
        awi -> aa / n _ (how limited would scope have to be?) 
        "aa" augmentation is always post-nasal (local person plural suffs end in n/m)
        but hard to get /nawi/ for local person singulars
        /i/ can come from /iban/, /inaan/ (reflecting noun analysis)
        but would /naw/ be local person singular suffix? 
            it would have to be restricted to occur before mode suffs
            hard to epenthesize these segs
        curious that local persons (sg/pl) are gaps before pret_dub suffix goban
            where coalescence would produce oo
        alternative: /na-iban/, /na-inaan/ (noun-style coalescence)
    valentine:233 nasal-final 3Sg forms are really problematic:
        Dub
        /gwekshinawidig/ -> [gwekshin_widig]
        /dgoshinawidig/ -> [dgoshnaadig] (aw -> aa, though coda w said to delete)
        /dgoshinawidigenag/ -> [dgoshnadgenag] (the two i's should not delete)
   valentine:232 long v-final forms ...
        /boodwewidigenan/ -> [boodwedgenan] (both cases of [i] shouldn't delete)

why is 3pl pret dub waagoban?
    Nichols:159 shows 3Pl -waa, -waaw

Nichols mentions a "compassionate" suffix, which I have not found in Valentine


nawi -> naa
