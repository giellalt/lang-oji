"who is doing what to who" is signaled in Algonquian languages by:
    person prefixes
    theme signs
    number suffixes
    peripheral suffixes (indexing obviation, etc)
 
####
# theme signs
####
 
theme signs are used to signal particular argument combinations:
    (or object agreement)
    -i      second person sub, first person obj
    -ini    first person sub, second person obj
    -igoo   first person plural sub, second person obj
    -aa:    third person objects (mostly, 3v3 requires more)
        Sub:    2   1   3
        Obj:    
        3       y   y   x
        3Obv    y   y   y
    -igo:   elsewhere
        Sub:    3   3Obv    0
        Obj:
        2       y   y       y
        1       y   y       y
        3       x   y       y
        3Obv    n   x       y
    and the passive theme signs (rerouted to VAI, and henceforth ignored):
    -aa    "+X" subject  (3rd person obj agr prior to promotion?)
    -igoo  "+X" subject  (elsewhere obj agr prior to promotion?)
 
theme signs are dependent on what prefixes are being employed:
    -i      only with second person
    -ini    only with second person
    -igoo   only with second person 
    -aa     with second, first or third persons (non-passive)
    -igo    with second, first or third persons (also inanimate)
    -aa     without person prefix (passive) -> VAI paradigm
    -igoo   only with first or second persons (passive) -> VAI paradigm
 
####
# Negation
####
 
the negation suffix -sii/-si may intervene between the theme sign and the number slot
I don't yet know the distribution of -sii/-si
 
####
# Number slot
####
 
number suffixes occur in the following configurations:
    -min    2nd person sub with 1pl obj
    -m      2pl with 1
    -naan   (1pl or 21) with (3, 0)
    -waa    (2pl or 3pl) with (3)
    -naawaa (2pl or 3pl) with (0)
    -n      (1Sg, 2Sg, 3Sg, 3Obv) with (0)

number suffixes are sensitive to whether only speech act participants are in predication
also sensitive to animacy of subject
also dependent on person prefix
    -min    only with second person
    -m      only with second person
    -naan   only with second person or first person
    -waa    only with second person or third person
    -naawaa only with (second person or third person) and inanimate subject
    -n      with any prefix
 
some dependency on theme sign
    -min    -i
    -m      -i, -ini, -igoo
    -naan   -aa, -igo
    -waa    -aa, -igo
    -naawaa -igo
    -n      -igo
 
also in this slot: inanimate subjects acting on non-plural objects are also marked with -n
 
####
# Mood slot
####
 
mood suffixes may intervene between the number slot and the peripheral suffixes
they almost certainly have special "augmented" forms depending on what suffixes precede or follow them

# Peripheral slot

X subjects are true passives, go straight to VAI paradigms (though obviously can't take +X suffix, as subject is promoted object)



3 obv sub ->  2 sg obj (conj): /iN-g/ 'iN theme, 3 post nas agr' = ik (N-lenis -> fortis), N-fortis -> fortis 

the dialects of Ojibwe have a fair amount of correspondence in the units used within the paradigms (differ in which suffixes are ported to which location)
    Rand has good ideas of how the porting has happened, it is a good idea to get them jotted down

participles formed with initial change, and j-in/j-ig suffixes

    wiisinid    Dustin (that Dustin ate)
    wiisiniwaad         (that they ate)
    waasinid    Dustin who ate
    waasinijig  they who ate (waasinidig -> waasinijig)
    waasininijin  the others who ate (waasininidin -> waasininijin)
