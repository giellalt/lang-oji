#Sins of omission
####

Indefinite posessors were left out
    these will need to be included
    and removed from non-dependent nouns

##The following classes were not exemplified:

NA_VINIT    V-initial word had already been provided    
NAD_A       Valentine's database provides no examples
NAD_CW      Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NAD_I       Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NAD_O       Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NAD_VLONG   Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NAD_VVW     Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NAD_VW      Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NID_CW      Valentine's database provides no examples
NID_VLONG   Dependent nouns only relevant for prefix behavior, final seg uninformative
NID_VVW     Valentine's database provides no examples
NID_VW      Valentine's database provides no examples
NI_CW       Valentine's database provides no examples (observed by Nichols 1980)
NI_VVW      Valentine's database provides no examples
NI_VW       Valentine's database provides no examples

    obviously anything that did not have a code in my system was not exemplified

##The following classes were redundantly added
X NI_O    abwaanaak_gt-norm.yaml
NI_O    miizhashk_gt-norm.yaml
X NI_VINIT    apanjigan_gt-norm.yaml
NI_VINIT    izhichigewin_gt-norm.yaml

##The following classes were an unfortunate mistake:
X NA_VLONGVW    ikwe_gt-norm.yaml
X NI_VLONGVW  bingode_gt-norm.yaml

##Despite the only noteworthy thing about dependent nouns being their behavior when prefixed, many suffix classes were exemplified as well with them

##NoExtra was pointlessly added to file names

##Some generated forms may be semantic gaps

##When using the description in the Nishnaabemwin Reference Grammar (Eastern)
##There is some danger of problems when applying the morphology to lexical items from
##the north (the Western dict's lexical materials come from the north)
##does [n] delete when word final in some morphemes in the West?
##To reflect Ojibwe, rather than Odawa, CW nouns are listed with wag plurals, not og plurals

#Content-specific points (consult valentine)
####
It appears that many nouns take plural allomorphs that are inconsistent with their listed stem class:

####
#Global Adjustments
####

X inanimate plurals need to end in [n]
    search for 7, replace "ag" with "an" at end of lines

X possessive suffixes need to only appear when person prefixes appear
    delete blocks containing 3, 5 if 1 is not present
    #PossObv may only appear if 1 is present as well
    #suffixes in slot 5 are not required when 1 is present
    #(poss doesn't need to be pl, and if poss is obv, still optional)
    #our organizational scheme is in concert with these facts

X possessive suffixes need to agree in person with person prefixes
    in blocks with 1 and 5
        delete lines that are not one of: 
            +Px1 .* +Pos1Pl
            +Px2 .* +PosPl
            +Px3 .* +PosPl
            +Px3 .* +PosObv
            #the following have not been instantiated!
            +PxIndef .* +PosPl (presumably)
            +PxIndef .* +PosObv (presumably)

X Vocative plurals cancel out slot 7
    in blocks with 6, 7
        delete lines with +VocPl

X Variation in form of vocative plural
    full form must be copied with each version of suffix, and placed in square brackets and separated by a comma

X Special plurals/obv after plural possessor suffixes
    in blocks with 5 followed by 7:
        "naanag" -> "naanig"
        "naanan" -> "naanin"
        "waaag" -> "waag"
        "waaan" -> "waan"
    Presumably something happens with -ini-ag... iniig?
    Presumably something happens with 5 followed by 6 too...
        ini-iban, ini-idog, waa-iban, waa-idog
        naan-iban, naanidog (no changes expected)
    acting and begging forgiveness... :)

X Special plurals/obv after contemptive suffix
    in blocks with 2, 7 adjacent:
        "hag" -> "yig"
        "han" -> "yin"

X h->y when contemptive suffix not word final
    in blocks with 2 followed by any of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    nh -> ny

X Special plurals after preterite suffix
    in blocks with 6,7 adjacent:
        ibanag -> ibaniig
        ibanan -> ibaniin
        ibaning -> ibaniing (?)

Excrescent nasals after first person ni?

Delete nasals from the ends of some suffixes when word final?

Indefinite possession only appears on dependents
    IF filename doesn't start with NAD or NID:
        in blocks with 1:
            delete lines ith +PxIndef

##VINIT (even if not labeled as such (arg))
[d] epenthesis between prefixes and stem
    in blocks with 1:
        write [d] after first [i] in lines w/ 1/2/indef
        write [d] after first [o] in lines w/ 3

UNLESS DEPENDENT Stem:
    in blocks with 1:
        delete first [i] in lines w/ 1/2/indef
        (presumably in indefinites too...)
        delete first [o] in lines w/ 3
        UNLESS stem starts with ii:
            change first [o] to [w] (V 200)

##VLONG
When adjacent to stem:
    slot 2: delete "e" from "ens", "eny", "enh#"
    slot 3: delete "i" from "im" 
    slot 4: delete "i" from "ish"
    slot 5: delete first "i" from  "inaan", "iwaa", "ini"
    slot 6: delete "i" from "iban", "idig, idog"
    slot 7: delete "a" from "an, ag", delete "i" from "ing"

##VVW
    slot 2: delete "e" from "ens", "eny", "enh#"
    slot 3: delete "i" from "im"
    slot 4: insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "ish"
    slot 5:

        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "iwaa"
        OR
        delete first "i" from  "inaan", "ini"
        ----- 
        but when possessed, VVW nouns must take -im
        so never stem-adjacent (V 204)
        **this restriction not enforced in protocol**
        #I smell wVW avoidance (?)
    slot 6: insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "iban, idig"
    slot 7:
        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "ag, an"
        OR
        delete "i" from "ing"

##VW
    slot 2: 
        delete "e" from "ens", "eny", "enh#"
        lengthen stem-final vowel
    slot 3: 
        delete "i" from "im"
        lengthen stem-final vowel
    slot 4:
        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "ish"
    slot 5: 
        unclear ... expect (V 203, 204):
        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "iwaa"
        OR
        delete first "i" from  "inaan", "ini"
        lengthen stem-final vowel
        ----- 
        but when possessed, VW nouns must take -im
        so never stem-adjacent (V 204)
        **this restriction not enforced in protocol**
        #I smell wVW avoidance (?)
    slot 6:
        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "iban, idig"
    slot 7:
        insert "w" between stem-final vowel and "ag, an"

        delete "i" from "ing"
        lengthen stem-final vowel

#Little wrinkles
####
Irregular contemptives and diminutives (Valentine 187)

A stems ending in n take pejorative ish, not aash (V 191)

Diminutive s -> z / _ pejorative i, "usually" palatalizes to "zh" (V 193)
    though apparently not if the diminutive is heavily lexicalized ... but V's example contradicts his claim

Indefinite possession was apparently limited to body parts. kinship did verbal derivatives (V 199)

Possessed theme is variably required in different communities
    some phonological rgularities noted (V 202)
    syncopated dialects are increasing usage (V 202)

Preterit dubitatives have not been discussed 

Obviative possessor "ini" is optional (V 203), there is no discussion regarding how suffixes that follow this suffix are realized (see global changes section above)

To reflect Ojibwe, rather than Odawa, CW nouns are listed with wag plurals, not og plurals
    this is also listed above

There is a class of Cay forms, where y is lost and [a] lengthened

Are there inanimates that take vocatives? "O grass!"

Presumably mode suffixes following possessive number/obv suffixes have phonology happening (cf notes on 5 followed by 7)
